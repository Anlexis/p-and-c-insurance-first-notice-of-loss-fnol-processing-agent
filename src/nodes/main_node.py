# INS-C2-015 — MainNode (reference node for the flat Cat 1 sample)
#
# This template is a Cat 2 two-layer agent: the `main` backbone slot is filled
# by FNOLRetrievalGraphNode (src/graph/graph.py), which delegates the domain
# RAG workflow to DomainWorkflowGraph. It is NOT filled by this node.
#
# MainNode is kept because src/examples/graph_cat1_sample.py — the flat,
# single-layer composition shown alongside the nested one — needs a concrete
# main-slot node to be a runnable illustration. It is the minimum a main-slot
# FunctionNode must do: declare its trust level, emit a domain audit event, and
# return a partial state dict. Nothing in the FNOL pipeline imports it.
